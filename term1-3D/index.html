            <p>This is the first attempt to bulid a <i>3D World</i> by coding!</p>

                In p5js, 3d World was built by random numbers, including shape, position, and size. 
                It also can be in <b>Math and Algorithm</b>. 
                I am always fansinating with chaos and random things. 
                In further study, I will focus on disordered work in three-dimensional and spacial form.
